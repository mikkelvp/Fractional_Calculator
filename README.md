# Fractional Calculator

<p>Traditional calculator layout used. Should be intuitive for anyone that has experience with fractions and calculators.</p>
<p>Enter number for numerator and use "Over" button to start specifying denominator, use operators to specify calculations.</p>
<p>Make calculations with operators: add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root.</p>
<p>Was first implemented to display fractions as a string, then modified to draw fractions.</p>
<p>Uses shunting yard algorithm.</p>
<p>UI needs more work, there is bugs displaying results of very large numbers.</p>
