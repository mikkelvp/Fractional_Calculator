<p>Traditional calculator layout used. Should be intuitive for anyone that has experience with fractions and calculators.</p>
<p>Enter number for numerator and use "Over" button to start specifying denominator, use operators to specify calculations.</p>
<p>Make calculations with operators: add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root.</p>
